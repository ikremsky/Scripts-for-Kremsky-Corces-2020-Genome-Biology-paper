# Transgenerational-epigenetic-inheritance
This repository contains the scripts that were used for data analysis in the Genome Biology paper by Kremsky & Corces (2020), "Protection from DNA re-methylation by transcription factors in primordial germ cells and pre-implantation embryos may explain trans-generational epigenetic inheritance".

Each folder is named according to the data set that was analyzed (data type and sample).  ".sh" files are bash scripts, and ".R" files are R scripts.  The original file paths originally used are unchanged in these scripts, so specific filepaths will need to be changed when downloading aned using these scripts locally.
